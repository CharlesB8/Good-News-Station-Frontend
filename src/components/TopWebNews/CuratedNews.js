                <p><br></br> After seeing his fellow Texas resident, 20-year-old Justin Corva, walking to work in the 95º Fahrenheit heat, Andy Mitchell decided to pull over and offer the young man a ride. From their conversation, he learned that Corva walks three miles to and from work every day because he couldn't afford a car.

Motivated by the man's dedication, Mitchell and other members of the community set up a donation box in a local restaurant and secured a deal from a local car dealer to purchase Corva a 2004 Toyota Camry complete with gas, insurance, and two years of oil changes. Fortunately for us, they caught the entire reveal—in which they surprise Corva with his new vehicle—on camera. And for ways to make the world a better place, be sure you're keenly aware of these</p>
