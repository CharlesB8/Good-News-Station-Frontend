The surprise of all is when the policeman arrived at the scene and asked her what she stole, she said, "Five Eggs To Feed My Hungry Children." The police officer took her back to the supermarket and bought her foodstuffs to feed herself and her kids. Miss Helena started crying and asked the police officer, "Sir this is too much for you have done for me..." The police officer replied, "Sometimes we shouldn't apply the law but must apply the humanity!" Credit to: Carol Robinson. crobinson@al.com </p>

                    <h1>An act of kindness</h1>
                    <p><br></br> After seeing his fellow Texas resident, 20-year-old Justin Corva, walking to work in the 95º Fahrenheit heat, Andy Mitchell decided to pull over and offer the young man a ride. From their conversation, he learned that Corva walks three miles to and from work every day because he couldn't afford a car.
Motivated by the man's dedication, Mitchell and other members of the community set up a donation box in a local restaurant and secured a deal from a local car dealer to purchase Corva a 2004 Toyota Camry complete with gas, insurance, and two years of oil changes.</p>
