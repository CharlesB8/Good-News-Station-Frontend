                    <h1>An act of kindness</h1>
                    <p><br></br> After seeing his fellow Texas resident, 20-year-old Justin Corva, walking to work in the 95ยบ Fahrenheit heat, Andy Mitchell decided to pull over and offer the young man a ride. From their conversation, he learned that Corva walks three miles to and from work every day because he couldn't afford a car.
Motivated by the man's dedication, Mitchell and other members of the community set up a donation box in a local restaurant and secured a deal from a local car dealer to purchase Corva a 2004 Toyota Camry complete with gas, insurance, and two years of oil changes.</p>
