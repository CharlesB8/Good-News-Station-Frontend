                        <p><br></br> This woman in picture with a police man is Helena from USA. She was caught stealing in the supermarket and the police was called to arrest her. The surprise of all is when the policeman arrived at the scene and asked her what she stole, she said, "Five Eggs To Feed My Hungry Children." The police officer took her back to the supermarket and bought her foodstuffs to feed herself and her kids. Miss Helena started crying and asked the police officer, "Sir this is too much for you have done for me..." The police officer replied, "Sometimes we shouldn't apply the law but must apply the humanity!" Credit to: Carol Robinson. crobinson@al.com </p>
